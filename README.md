Google code Jam question : Speaking in Tongues

To translate text into Googlerese, we take any message and replace each English letter with another English letter. This mapping is one-to-one and onto, which means that the same input letter always gets replaced with the same output letter, and different input letters always get replaced with different output letters. A letter may be replaced by itself. Spaces are left as-is.

For example (and here is a hint!), our awesome translation algorithm includes the following three mappings: 'a' -> 'y', 'o' -> 'e', and 'z' -> 'q'. This means that "a zoo" will become "y qee".

Input:

ejp mysljylc kd kxveddknmc re jsicpdrysi rbcpc ypc rtcsra dkh wyfrepkym veddknkmkrkcd de kr kd eoya kw aej tysr re ujdr lkgc jv


Output:
 our language is impossible to understand there are twenty six factorial possibilities so it is okay if you want to just give up
